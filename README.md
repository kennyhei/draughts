Classic board game with isometric style thanks to [Isomer](http://jdan.github.io/isomer/) graphics library. Made with HTML + CSS + JavaScript combo.

You can try the (incomplete) multiplayer online version here which was done with Socket.io: https://shrouded-escarpment-7226.herokuapp.com/
Requires two players (or open two browser windows and play against yourself).

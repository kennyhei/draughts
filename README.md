# draughts
Classic board game with isometric style thanks to [Isomer](http://jdan.github.io/isomer/) graphics library. Made with HTML + CSS + JavaScript combo.

Master branch contains offline version of the game. Web branch contains online version of the game done with [Socket.io](http://socket.io/). Both versions are unfinished.

Offline version of the game is directly available [here](http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/kennyhei/isomer/).
